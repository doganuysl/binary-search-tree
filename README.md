## Binary Search Tree

Binary search trees take an active role in solving many problems. For example; Binary search among search algorithms, clustering sort among sorting algorithms make use of this tree structure and achieve very successful results.

### Purpose of this code

This code inserts the words from a given text file into a node tree and prints the words in different orders.
The words added to the tree structure are sorted in alphabetical order and if the same words are added again, their counts are increased.
Please pay attention to search the word in Words.txt as is (case sensitive) otherwise it will not give the desired result.

Make sure that the file is named "Words.txt" and that it is in the same directory as the program.
If the file is not found or is not in the correct location, the program will not work as expected.
Additionally, make sure that the file is in the correct format, with one word per line, to ensure that the program can read the words from the file properly.
